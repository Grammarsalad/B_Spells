There are numerous differences between IWDEE spells and BG(2)EE spells.  This component will give the option to alter all spells of one version to the other version (note, though, that this component will not change aesthetic features of a given spell, such as sound effects or graphics).  There will be subcomponents to allow the user to change all spells to the 'IWDEE' standard, the 'BG(2)EE' standard, or to decide on a case by case basis.  If SR is installed, then there will also be an option to keep the SR variant whenever a given conflict also has been altered by SR.  This will also be available as a complete package or on a spell by spell basis.

**Special Note regarding SR**: There are a few spells that SR completely replaces.  In all cases, those new spells will be preserved. There will be a separate component to reintroduce those missing spells where appropriate.  

**Opposition Schools**: Opposition schools are mentioned here, but will be addressed in a separate component.
