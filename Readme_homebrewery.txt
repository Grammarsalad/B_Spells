##### A mod for the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate I and II, Icewind Dale, and EET<br><br><br>
##### Grammarsalad
##### Version 0.89.08 (2019-05-11)
</div>

# Overview 

<br>
The purpose of this mod is to improve the EE experience by adding new and revised spells, as well as new options for spellcasters (and, in some cases, non-spell casters).    

## Engine and Mod Compatibility

### **Engine Compatibility**
- Faiths and Powers only works on the Enhanced Engine versions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, Baldur's Gate II, and Icewind Dale.  

- Faiths and Powers should also work on [Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/195-enhanced-edition-trilogy/)

### **Install Order** 
If you plan to use the Revised Spells Components, especially the global components, you should  install Spells and Magic after any other spell mods that add new spells to the game (please let me know about any spell mods that I have missed).  Otherwise, use your best judgement in terms of install order.  Because new spells are added using ADD_SPELL, install order should matter less, at least with regards to mods that do not change the spell system in any major way.  In such cases, please let me know where there are conflicts and I will do my best to address them.  

#### **Install Order: Spells and Magic:** 

The following mods should be installed _before_  Spells_and_Magic:

- [Item Revisions](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/ItemRevisions/releases)
- [IWDification (S&M will defer to IWD spells installed by IWDification)](https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/948-iwdification/)
- [More Style for Mages](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/18108/item-mod-more-style-for-mages-ranged-wizard-s-staffs-circlets-robe-visual-tweaks-for-bg-ee/p1)
- [Spell Revisions](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/SpellRevisions/releases)
- [Tome and Blood](https://github.com/subtledoctor/TomeAndBlood/releases)

The following mods can be compatible if installed _either before or after_ Spells_and_Magic:

- [Faiths and Powers](https://github.com/subtledoctor/Faiths_and_Powers/releases)
- [OlvynSpells](https://github.com/OlvynChuru/OlvynSpells)

The following mods should installed _after_ Spells_and_Magic:

- [Deities of Faerûn](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/30780-kit-pack-deities-of-faer%C3%BBn-bgee-bg2ee-iwdee-and-eet/#comments)
- [Scales of Balance](https://github.com/UnearthedArcana/Scales_of_Balance/releases)
- [Sword Coast Stratagems](https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/914-sword-coast-stratagems/)
- [The Tweaks Anthology](https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/973-the-tweaks-anthology/)

The following mods are _not_ compatible with Faiths and Powers (we'll see about changing that in the future):
```
```

## Bugs 
If you encounter a bug while using this mod, please post on the mod thread on the Beamdog forums, or in the issues thread on github (links located below). While reporting bugs, please provide your WeiDu log, the game, and the game version. 

### Known Bugs (and plans for the future)

https://github.com/UnearthedArcana/B_Spells/issues  
  
BEAMDOG LINK Forthcoming

### Known Issues

- The illusory summoning spells (Phantasmal Force, Improved Phantasmal Force and Spectral Force) added by this mod allows players to bypass the normal limits on summoned monsters (i.e. they will be able to summon the maximum plus any creatures summoned by these spells.) 
- Ranger Exclusive spells like Stormbow can become available to druids where their alignment restrictions have been expanded.  Specifically, druids that can become something other than morally neutral will have access to these spells.

- **Range**: Touch   
- **Duration**: 8 Hours   
- **Casting Time**: 9   
- **Area of Effect**: 1 creature    
- **Saving Throw**: None    

This spell stimulates the body, boosting the recipient's natural defenses against death and poison, and allowing them to heal at an increased rate.   
At first level, recipients heal 1 hit point per hour, and gain a +1 bonus to save vs. death.  For each 5 levels, the recipient heals an additional hit point per hour, and gains an additional +1 to save vs. death (max 5 hp/hour and +5 vs. death at 20th level).   
Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.   

>***Notes***:    
**1st level cantrips**: Converted to a second level spell, unchanged 

#### **Alarm** (New)       
___
(Divination)   
- **Level**: 1   
- **Range**: 0   
- **Duration**: Special   
- **Casting Time**: 9   
- **Area of Effect**: Special   
- **Saving Throw**: None   

When alarm is cast, the caster and <PRO_HISHER> allies are alerted if any creature, visible or invisible, with hostile intent comes within 30' of <PRO_HIMHER> by a mental or audible alarm.   
This alarm awakens the caster and <PRO_HISHER> allies, and makes them alert to all enemies, giving them a +2 bonus to weapon and casting speed for a single round.  This spell cannot be cast in the presence of enemies.    
Once the ward is set, it protects the caster and <PRO_HISHER> allies as long as they stay within the general area.  The ward lasts for 8 hours or until triggered.   

>***Notes***:    
**1st level cantrips**: Converted to a second level spell, unchanged  

```
```

#### **Anticipation** (New)    
___
(Divination)  
- **Level**: 1  
- **Range**: 0  
- **Casting Time**: 0  
- **Duration**: 3 rounds  
- **Area of Effect**: The caster   
- **Saving Throw**: None   

This spell gives the caster a temporary, intuitive foreknowledge of the immediate future, resulting in improved reaction time granting a +5 bonus to AC, and +1 to weapon and casting speed for 3 rounds.

> ***Notes***:    
**1st Level Cantrips**: This spell is converted to a second level spell, and the duration increased to 1 turn.

#### **Detect Traps and Portals** (New)   
___
(Divination)   
- **Level**: 1   
- **Range**: 0   
- **Duration**: 1 hour   
- **Casting Time**: 9   
- **Area of Effect**: Special   
- **Saving Throw**: None   

With this spell, the mage can detect traps and secret doors, as if <PRO_HESHE> were a Thief.  When <PRO_HESHE> casts this spell, <PRO_HESHE> has a chance to detect traps equal to 30%, +5% for each additional level after first (max 75% at level 10) for one hour.  <PRO_HESHE> need not take a special action, <PRO_HESHE> will automatically look for traps for the duration as long as this spell is in effect, and <PRO_HESHE> is not doing anything else.   
This chance to detect spells stacks with any preexisting skill the mage might otherwise have with detect traps, and if <PRO_HESHE> has levels in thief, this spell will give <PRO_HIMHER> a bonus to disarm traps as well.   

>***Notes***:    
**1st level cantrips**: Converted to a second level spell, +20% to skill bonus (maxes out at 95%)  

\page
#### **Enervating Ray** (New)    
___
(Necromancy)   
- **Level**: 1   
- **Range**: 40 ft.  
- **Duration**: 1 round/level  
- **Casting Time**: 2  
- **Area of Effect**: 1 creature  
- **Saving Throw**: Special   

When this spell is cast, a ray slams into the target chosen by the caster, sapping their energy and knocking the wind out of them.  At first level, this spell does 2d4 non-lethal damage to the target, and, if they do not save vs. death, penalizes their AC, THAC0 and Saves by -1.   
Damage increases by 2d4 at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter (max 10d4 at 9th level).  The penalties are increased by -1 at 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter (max -5 at 20th level).  
Undead and creatures without a biological anatomy are immune to Enervating Ray.   

>***Notes***:    
**1st level cantrips**: Damage is reduced to 1/2, but kept as a 1st level spell

#### **Devil's Eyes** (Revised)   
___
(Divination)   
- **Level**: 1   
- **Range**: 30 ft.   
- **Duration**: 1 Turn   
- **Casting Time**: 1   
- **Area of Effect**: 1 creature   
- **Saving Throw**: None   

Upon the casting of this spell the recipient gains the sight of an infernal being.  This allows them to not only see in the dark as per the infravision ability, but it allows them to see and exploit vulnerabilities in their targets, allowing them to more often land critical blows.  As such, they crit on a natural roll of an 19 or above.   

>_**Notes**_:  I have no problem with Spell Revisions replacement for Infravision--True Strike--and I do agree that infravision alone is a rather poor 1st level spell.  But, I wanted to have a spell that still grants infravision for the few times that its useful, and further, that gives 'something extra'.  
**METweaks**: 

```
```

#### **Invisibility to Undead**  (New)      
___
(Abjuration)   
- **Level**: 1  
- **Range**: Touch   
- **Casting Time**: 4   
- **Duration**:  1 Turn     
- **Area of Effect**: 1 creature   
- **Saving Throw**: None   

This spell causes nearby undead to lose track of and ignore the warded creature for the duration of the spell.  This spell is effective against undead with 4 Hit Die or undead with Hit Die equal to the caster's level, whichever is higher.  Note that unlike normal invisibility, the recipient of this spell can still attack undead creatures without losing the invisibility.   Priests affected by this spell cannot turn undead.  

>***Notes***:  
**1st Level Cantrips**: This spell is converted to an Second Level Spell if 1st level cantrips is installed, and the spell is effective against all undead for the duration. 

#### **Protection From Evil** (Revised)   
___
(Abjuration)  
- **Level**: 1  
- **Range**: Touch  
- **Duration**: 5 turns  
- **Casting Time**: 1  
- **Area of Effect**: 1 creature  
- **Saving Throw**: None  

When this spell is cast, a magical barrier forms around the recipient and moves with <PRO_HIMHER>. The barrier has two effects: First, it bestows a +2 bonus to the recipient's Armor Class and Saving Throws against attacks from evil-aligned opponents; second, **it grants a +2 bonus to saves vs. enchantment spells.**  

>_**Notes**_:  See Priest version

#### **Farseer**  (New)  
___
(Divination)  
**Level**: 1  
**Range**: Touch  
**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Casting Time**: 2  
**Area of Effect**: 1 creature

Affected creatures shake off this effect if they are attacked.  

>***Notes***:    
**1st level cantrips**: Converted to a second level spell, unchanged

#### **Vanish** (New)   
___
(Illusion/Phantasm)   
- **Level**: 1   
- **Range**: 0  
- **Duration**: 1 round, +1 round per 2 levels  
- **Casting Time**: 1  
- **Area of Effect**: The caster  
- **Saving Throw**: None  

This spell turns the caster invisible and makes <PRO_HIMHER> undetectable by normal vision or infravision. The spell remains in effect for 1 round, +1 round per 2 levels after 1st, level (max 5 rounds at levl 9), until it is magically broken or dispelled, or until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if <PRO_HESHE> attacks or casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first).    

>***Notes***:

On the third round, the creature suffers 1 point of damage per level (max 15).

>***Notes***:    

\page
### Level 4

#### **Charm Monster**  (New)   
(Enchantment/Charm)  
Level: 4   
Range: Visual range of the caster   
Duration: 5 rounds  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 1 person or monster  
Saving Throw: Neg.  
This spell affects any single person or monster it is cast upon. The term monster includes any non-undead, non-construct, non-extraplanar creature, such as an ogre or even a dragon.  The target is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect (a person, as described by charm person, saves at -4).  
If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.  
If the caster harm or attempts to harm the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed creature, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he is charmed.  

>***Notes***:    
**Revised Charm**: This spell is only installed if Revised Charm global revision is installed

Level: 4   
Range: 0  
Duration: 1 hour  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: the caster   
Saving Throw: None  
When this spell is cast, the caster is able to "see" and "hear" everything in <PRO_HISHER> immediate area, as though the environmental conditions are ideal for sight and sound, and <PRO_HESHE> can effectively "see" twice as far as before.  <PRO_HESHE> needs no sensory organs for this detection, and, as such, effects that blind or deafen are effectively dispelled.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> need not fear such effects as long as this spell is in place.  
<PRO_HESHE> effectively gains infravision while this spell is in effect, and <PRO_HISHER> preternatural awareness of <PRO_HISHER> surroundings grants a -2 bonus to <PRO_HISHER> armor class.    
This spell does not grant any special benefits against illusions.

#### **Phantasmal Killer** (New)  
(Illusion/Phantasm)  
Level: 4  
Range: 50 ft.  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Special  
When this spell is cast, the caster creates the illusion of the most fearsome thing imaginable to the target, transforming the fears of their subconscious mind into something that the conscious mind can visualize--the most horrible beast. Only the target can see the phantasmal killer.  
The phantasmal killer attacks, automatically 'hitting' the target, forcing them to make a Saving Throw vs. Spell. Success means that the illusion is disbelieved and nothing happens. If the target fails, another Saving Throw, this time vs. Death, must be rolled. Success means that the victim will be in panic for 4 rounds and take 4d6 points of magic damage. Failing in this second test kills the victim instantly.
This spell has no effect over constructs and undead.

### Level 5

#### **Snilloc's Major Missile** (New)  
(Evocation)  
Level: 5   
Range: Visual range of the caster   
Duration: Instant   
Casting Time: 1   
Area of Effect: 1 creature   
Saving Throw: None   
Major Missile is much like Magic Missile, creating a single missile of magical energy that darts forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. This missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage, plus 1d4+1 for every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of 15d4 +15.

>***Notes***:    

#### **Usurp Shell** (New)   
(Necromancy)  
Level: 5  
Range: 60 ft.  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 1 creature   
Saving Throw: Special  
With this spell the caster attempts to bypass the targets mind, taking direct control of their body instead if they do not make a save vs. death -2.  Unlike a dominate spell, this spell does not touch the mind, and can even be used to usurp the body of an undead creature, or any creature with biological anatomy.  
If this spell is sucessful, the caster gains control of the targets body, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to make the body attack or move as <PRO_HESHE> pleases. <PRO_HESHE> does not gain fine motor control of the tergets body, however, nor does <PRO_HESHE> gain control of the targets mind. Thus,  <PRO_HESHE> cannot force the target to cast spells or use special abilities on <PRO_HISHER> behalf.  
Additionally, the targets movements are jerky and predicable, and they move at 80% their normal speed and suffer a -2 to all attack rolls.   
If the target resists the spell, they suffer 3d8 points of magic damage.

This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.  
A caster cannot benefit from multiple castings of Siphon Vitality.

The bullet itself doesn't do much damage--targets take 1 point--but the target must save vs. poison or choke on the fumes, suffering 1 point of poison damage per second, and is penalized for -1 to AC for 6 seconds.  
This bullet is not well balanced, and it is difficult to shoot accuracy.  As such, it imposes a -2 penalty to hit.

**General**: Set to Opposition School: Necromancy unless IWDEE style spells is installed (where it will be Abjurer as in IWDEE)

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 4d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half.

**General**: Set to Opposition School: Enchantment unless IWDEE style spells is installed (where it will be Conjurer as in IWDEE)

### Level 6

#### **Animate Clay Construct** (New)  
(Alteration)

- **Level**: 6
- **Sphere**: Creation
- **Range**: Visual range of the caster
- **Duration**: 1 turn
- **Casting Time**: 5
- **Area of Effect**: n/a
- **Saving Throw**: None.

Upon casting this spell, a mass of material is drawn from the environment, shaped into roughly humanoid form, and imbued with a modicum of sentience.  The resulting construct is similar to a clay golem: able to follow rudimentary directions and attack the caster's foes, but lacking complex thought and reflection.  After ten rounds, the magic holding the construct together fades, and the construct dissipates into dirt.

>***Notes***:    

#### **Shades** (IWDEE)   
(Illusion/Phantasm)   

- **Level**: 6   
- **Range**: Visual range of the caster   
- **Duration**: 1 round/level   
- **Casting Time**: 6   
- **Area of Effect**: Special   
- **Saving Throw**: None    

Shades is similar to Shadow Monsters and Demi-Shadow Monstersâit allows the caster to shape material from the Demiplane of Shadow into illusionary creatures. These shadows are tougher than the shadows summoned by Shadow Monsters and Demi-Shadow Monsters, and they will obey the caster until the spell expires or they are slain.  

>***Notes***:    
**General**: Set to Opposition School: Necromancy unless IWDEE style spells is installed (where it will be Abjurer as in IWDEE)

\page
### Level 7

#### **Acid Storm** (IWDEE)   
(Evocation)   

- **Level**: 7  
- **Range**: Visual range of the caster  
- **Duration**: 1 round/level  
- **Casting Time**: 7  
- **Area of Effect**: 24-ft. radius  
- **Saving Throw**: 1/2   

This spell unleashes an acidic downpour on the area of effect, doing 1d4 points of acid damage each round for the first three rounds, 1d6 points for the next three rounds, and 1d8 points for each round thereafter. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage.  The acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer acid damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a Save vs. Spell every round after they have been hit by the cloud.  If successful, they only take half damage (for that round only).  

>***Notes***:    
**General**: Set to Opposition School: Enchantment unless IWDEE style spells is installed (where it will be Conjurer as in IWDEE)  

#### **Animate Stone Construct** (New)  
(Alteration)  
  
- **Level**: 7
- **Sphere**: Creation
- **Range**: Visual range of the caster
- **Duration**: 1 turn
- **Casting Time**: 5
- **Area of Effect**: n/a
- **Saving Throw**: None.

Upon casting this spell, a mass of rocky material is drawn from the environment, shaped into roughly humanoid form, and imbued with a modicum of sentience.  The resulting construct is similar to a stone golem: able to follow rudimentary directions and attack the caster's foes, but lacking complex thought and reflection.  After ten rounds, the magic holding the construct together fades, and the construct dissipates into rocks and gravel.

# Cantrips and Orisons


There are two mutually exclusive versions of cantrips that can be installed for both arcane and divine casters.  All versions of cantrips are usable 'at will' meaning that the caster will always have something 'magical' to do in (or out of) combat.  The two kinds of cantrips are 1st level cantrips or 0 level cantrips.  If you install 1st level cantrips, all of your first level slots count as cantrips meaning that you can use your first level spells as often as you like, though some spells will be reduced in power or converted to a higher level for balance purposes.  0 level cantrips are prepared much like normal spells but are cast as innate abilities.  Where there are cantrips with 1st and 0 level variants, the 0 level versions tend to be weaker.  Note that arcane and divine cantrips are installed separately and you can have different versions of each (e.g. 0 level cantrips for wizards and 1st level cantrips for priests).

**Notes** 
- Mages: After 1st level, mages must learn cantrps the same way they learn other spells.  They must find a scroll containing the cantrip which they learn as normal.  Specialist mages must learn at least one cantrip of their favored school at first level.  In addition, they can prepare an additional cantrip but that slot must be filled by a cantrip of their favored school.
- Clerics and Druids begin play knowing all cantrips (if FnP or DoF is installed, they know all cantrips belonging to spheres they have access to).  
- Sorcerers and Shaman do not prepare cantrips.  Rather, they can cast all cantrips that they know.

#### Benediction   
___
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
- **Level**: Orison  
- **Sphere**: All  
- **Range**: 0  
- **Duration**: Special  
- **Casting Time**: 9  
- **Area of Effect**: The caster  
- **Saving Throw**: None  
  
Upon casting this spell, the priest chants softly under <PRO_HISHER> breath.  As long as <PRO_HESHE> continues to chant, <PRO_HESHE> receives a +1 to moral, THAC0 rolls, and damage, much like a bless spell.    
However, while <PRO_HESHE> can fight normally, <PRO_HESHE> cannot cast spells, nor turn undead while under the effects of Benediction.  
Benediction has no effect if the priest is under the effects of bless, aid, or chant spell, and if <PRO_HESHE> is affected by one of these spells while under the effects of this Orison, Benediction is immediately dispelled.  
Similarly, <PRO_HESHE> cannot cast Benediction if <PRO_HESHE> is under the influence of the Doom spell.   
Benediction cannot be used in conjunction with canticle or meditation.

# Spell Revisions

This section describes different global revision spell components.
## Global Changes

### Healing Revision  
This component changes heal and cause/inflict spells (if installed) to have varying effects depending on the target of the spell.  Specifically, these spells heal or inflict wounds based on the maximum hit points of the target (plus a little extra).  Spells work as follows:

#### Cantrips

**Heal/Inflict Minor Wounds**: 10% target's max hit points, +2 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).  
Note: Only applicable if Cantrips is installed.

#### Level 1

**Cure/Inflict Light Wounds**: 20% target's max hit points, +4 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

#### Level 2

**Cure/Inflict Moderate Wounds**: 30% target's max hit points, +6 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).  
Note: Only applicable if CMW installed (or IWDEE).

**Goodberry**: Berrys heal 10% of target's max hit points.

#### Level 3

**Cure/Infict Medium Wounds**: 40% target's max hit points, +8 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

#### Level 4

**Cure/Inflict Serius Wounds**: 50% target's max hit points, +10 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

**Neutralize Poison**: 20% target's max hit points (in addition to normal cure).

#### Level 5

**Cure/Inflict Critical Wounds**: 60% target's max hit points, +12 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal)

**Mass Cure**: 25% target's max hit points, +6 hit points

#### Level 6

#### Level 7

**Mist of Eldath**: 60% target's max hit points

### Charm Revision  
This component revises charm spells, making charmed creatures friendly but uncontrollable (as with a dominate spell).  Rather, when a charmed creature is in the middle of a fight between their former friends and a charming caster, they will 'stand there conflicted' helping neither side.    

### Neutral Spell Names
This component renames a number of spells to make them more 'neutral'. There are two different subcomponents: one that renames priest spells (generally to get rid of god names), and the other renames mage spells (generally to get rid of founder's names).

**Mist of Eldath**: Renamed to Clensing Mist

# Magic Item Creation and Addition

This component adds new magic items, and item creation.

**Note**: The added items are identical to those added by Spells and Magic and B_Kits. However, consumable magic items--in particular scrolls and wands--work slightly differently in these three mods.  These mods are completely compatible, however, and any changes will be noted in the description.
