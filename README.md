Area of Effect: The caster

When the caster completes this spell and touches an allied undead ally, <PRO_HESHE> gains the ability to see through that creature's eyes allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to see everything that it sees.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> has greater influence over the creature, making it attack more effectively, granting it a +4 bonus to attack rolls.

While this spell is in effect, the caster's body is helpless, as <PRO_HESHE> is helpless, and blind. 

_If Cantrips and Orisons is installed, Eyes of the Dead becomes and Orison with no changes._
