Saving Throw: Polymorph 1/2  

When the priest cast's this spell, <PRO_HESHE> creates a vibrating pulse that increases in intensity in a nearby creature or object that is especially destructive against inorganic, solid constructs like doors and golems. The first round, a living or undead creature takes 2d6 crushing damage unless they save vs. polymorph (in which case, they take half damage and the spell ends). Every round that they do not save, they suffer the amount of damage that they received in the last round, plus an additional 2d6 points of damage for a maximum of 4 rounds. Any round that they do save, they suffer 1/2 damage and the spell ends.

When cast on a door or locked container, it undermines the integrity of the object destroying all but the most sturdy or magically protected locks. Against constructs such as golems, and elementals it does double damage, and they cannot save to avoid its effects.

This chance to detect spells stacks with any preexisting skill the mage might otherwise have with detect traps, and if <PRO_HESHE> has levels in thief, this spell will give <PRO_HIMHER> a bonus to disarm traps as well.

Affected creatures shake off this effect if they are attacked.

Damage increases by 2d4 at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter (max 10d4 at 9th level).  The penalties are increased by -1 at 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter (max -5 at 20th level).

The spell remains in effect for 1 round/level (max 10 rounds), until it is magically broken or dispelled, or until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if <PRO_HESHE> attacks or casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first).

***Notes***:

(Evocation)

***Notes***:    
**General**: Set to Opposition School: Enchantment unless IWDEE style spells is installed (where it will be Conjurer as in IWDEE)

### Level 5

**Usurp Shell** (New)  
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell the caster attempts to bypass the targets mind, taking direct control of their body instead if they do not make a save vs. death -2.  Unlike a dominate spell, this spell does not touch the mind, and can even be used to usurp the body of an undead creature, or any creature with biological anatomy.

If this spell is sucessful, the caster gains control of the targets body, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to make the body attack or move as <PRO_HESHE> pleases. <PRO_HESHE> does not gain fine motor control of the tergets body, however, nor does <PRO_HESHE> gain control of the targets mind. Thus, <PRO_HESHE> cannot force the target to cast spells or use special abilities on <PRO_HISHER> behalf.

Additionally, the targets movements are jerky and predicable, and they move at 80% their normal speed and suffer a -2 to all attack rolls. 

If the target resists the spell, they suffer 3d8 points of magic damage.

### Level 6

**Shades** (IWDEE)  
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 6  
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  

Shades is similar to Shadow Monsters and Demi-Shadow Monstersâ€”it allows the caster to shape material from the Demiplane of Shadow into illusionary creatures. These shadows are tougher than the shadows summoned by Shadow Monsters and Demi-Shadow Monsters, and they will obey the caster until the spell expires or they are slain.

***Notes***:    
**General**: Set to Opposition School: Necromancy unless IWDEE style spells is installed (where it will be Abjurer as in IWDEE)

### Level 7

**Acid Storm** (IWDEE)  
(Evocation)

Level: 7  
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 7  
Area of Effect: 24-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell unleashes an acidic downpour on the area of effect, doing 1d4 points of acid damage each round for the first three rounds, 1d6 points for the next three rounds, and 1d8 points for each round thereafter. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damageâ€”the acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer acid damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a Save vs. Spell every round after they have been hit by the cloudâ€”if successful, they only take half damage (for that round only).

***Notes***:    
**General**: Set to Opposition School: Enchantment unless IWDEE style spells is installed (where it will be Conjurer as in IWDEE)


## Cantrips and Orisons

There are two mutually exclusive versions of cantrips that can be installed for both arcane and divine casters.  All versions of cantrips are usable 'at will' meaning that the caster will always have something 'magical' to do in (or out of) combat.  The two kinds of cantrips are 1st level cantrips or 0 level cantrips.  If you install 1st level cantrips, all of your first level slots count as cantrips meaning that you can use your first level spells as often as you like, though some spells will be reduced in power or converted to a higher level for balance purposes.  0 level cantrips are prepared much like normal spells but are cast as innate abilities.  Where there are cantrips with 1st and 0 level variants, the 0 level versions tend to be weaker.  Note that arcane and divine cantrips are installed separately and you can have different versions of each (e.g. 0 level cantrips for wizards and 1st level cantrips for priests).

**Notes** 
- Mages: After 1st level, mages must learn cantrps the same way they learn other spells.  They must find a scroll containing the cantrip which they learn as normal.  Specialist mages must learn at least one cantrip of their favored school at first level.  In addition, they can prepare an additional cantrip but that slot must be filled by a cantrip of their favored school.
- Clerics and Druids begin play knowing all cantrips (if FnP or DoF is installed, they know all cantrips belonging to spheres they have access to).  
- Sorcerers and Shaman do not prepare cantrips.  Rather, they can cast all cantrips that they know.

## Global Changes

### Healing Revision  
This component changes heal and cause/inflict spells (if installed) to have varying effects depending on the target of the spell.  Specifically, these spells heal or inflict wounds based on the maximum hit points of the target (plus a little extra).  Spells work as follows:

#### Cantrips

**Heal/Inflict Minor Wounds**: 10% target's max hit points, +2 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).  
Note: Only applicable if Cantrips is installed.

#### Level 1

**Cure/Inflict Light Wounds**: 20% target's max hit points, +4 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

#### Level 2

**Cure/Inflict Moderate Wounds**: 30% target's max hit points, +6 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).  
Note: Only applicable if CMW installed (or IWDEE).

**Goodberry**: Berrys heal 10% of target's max hit points.

#### Level 3

**Cure/Infict Medium Wounds**: 40% target's max hit points, +8 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

#### Level 4

**Cure/Inflict Serius Wounds**: 50% target's max hit points, +10 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

**Neutralize Poison**: 20% target's max hit points (in addition to normal cure).

#### Level 5

**Cure/Inflict Critical Wounds**: 60% target's max hit points, +12 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal)

**Mass Cure**: 25% target's max hit points, +6 hit points

#### Level 6

#### Level 7

**Mist of Eldath**: 60% target's max hit points

### Charm Revision  
This component revises charm spells, making charmed creatures friendly but uncontrollable (as with a dominate spell).  Rather, when a charmed creature is in the middle of a fight between their former friends and a charming caster, they will 'stand there conflicted' helping neither side.    

### Neutral Spell Names
This component renames a number of spells to make them more 'neutral'. There are two different subcomponents: one that renames priest spells (generally to get rid of god names), and the other renames mage spells (generally to get rid of founder's names).

**Mist of Eldath**: Renamed to Clensing Mist
