# Spell Revisions

## Global Changes

### Healing Revision  
This component changes heal and cause/inflict spells (if installed) to have varying effects depending on the target of the spell.  Specifically, these spells heal or inflict wounds based on the maximum hit points of the target (plus a little extra).  Spells work as follows:

#### Cantrips

**Heal/Inflict Minor Wounds**: 10% target's max hit points, +2 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).  
Note: Only applicable if Cantrips is installed.

#### Level 1

**Cure/Inflict Light Wounds**: 20% target's max hit points, +4 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

#### Level 2

**Cure/Inflict Moderate Wounds**: 30% target's max hit points, +6 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).  
Note: Only applicable if CMW installed (or IWDEE).

**Goodberry**: Berrys heal 10% of target's max hit points.

#### Level 3

**Cure/Infict Medium Wounds**: 40% target's max hit points, +8 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

#### Level 4

**Cure/Inflict Serius Wounds**: 50% target's max hit points, +10 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal).

**Neutralize Poison**: 20% target's max hit points (in addition to normal cure).

#### Level 5

**Cure/Inflict Critical Wounds**: 60% target's max hit points, +12 hit points (inflict save for 1/2 as normal)

**Mass Cure**: 25% target's max hit points, +6 hit points

#### Level 6

#### Level 7

**Mist of Eldath**: 60% target's max hit points

### Charm Revision  
This component revises charm spells, making charmed creatures friendly but uncontrollable (as with a dominate spell).  Rather, when a charmed creature is in the middle of a fight between their former friends and a charming caster, they will 'stand there conflicted' helping neither side.    

### Neutral Spell Names
This component renames a number of spells to make them more 'neutral'. There are two different subcomponents: one that renames priest spells (generally to get rid of god names), and the other renames mage spells (generally to get rid of founder's names).

**Mist of Eldath**: Renamed to Clensing Mist
